  ; When a new branch is created with git branch or git checkout that tracks
  ; another branch, this variable tells git to set up pull to rebase instead of
  ; merge (see "branch.<name>.rebase"). When never, rebase is never automatically
  ; set to true. When local, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of other
  ; local branches. When remote, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of
  ; remote-tracking branches. When always, rebase will be set to true for all
  ; tracking branches.
